# Autopilot progress

Human-facing journal for the unattended runs (see `AUTOPILOT.md`). The
autopilot rewrites **Status** and **Next steps** at the end of every run and
the cron script appends to **Runs and quota**. The only section a human
writes is **Feedback**.

## Feedback


## Addressed

## Status

**Mission 2 (headless game state for Graziani's Offensive) Part 0 is up
for review** (2026-10-08): spec and six slice plans in PR #5, labelled
`needs-brian`. Nothing for Mission 2 is built until **Feedback** approves
it. The PR also bumps `vendor/cna` to 39b9ad7, which has the scenario, OA
and schedule data cna landed for this mission.

**MISSION 1 COMPLETE** (2026-09-26): rules core with switches for R-001,
R-009, R-011, R-012, R-015, R-018 and eight probes in `probes/` (PRs #1–#4).

## Next steps

- **Review the Mission 2 spec: PR #5.** Approve (or ask for changes) under
  **Feedback**.

For the autopilot: once Feedback approves, merge PR #5 and start slice 1
(map). Until then, nothing to build.

## Requests for cna

What this repo needs from cna, one bullet each: what, why, which mission it
blocks. cna's autopilot reads this every run and answers with a PR; delete
the bullet once it lands and `vendor/cna` is bumped.

- **Cross-sheet hex adjacency** in `data/map/`: which hexes face each other
  across each sheet edge ("join along printed hex numbers"), with the
  features of those hexsides (today's `a|SIDE` edge records). Without it a
  unit cannot move from sheet C to D. Blocks Mission 2 slice 4 (movement).
- **Weapon systems** (4.47–4.49) as `data/tables/weapon-systems.json`, which
  `common.schema.json`'s `toe` already refers to: per-weapon ratings for
  tanks and guns. Blocks Mission 2 slice 5 (combat) for tank and gun units.
- **Victory supply in a Land-only game:** 60.8's "suppliable by convoy from
  Tobruk / map D" and "a truck-convoy route to Cairo or Alexandria" have no
  §32 meaning; state one (structured in `victory`, or a ruling). Blocks the
  supply half of Mission 2 slice 6's victory check.
- **Stacking equivalent per unit-characteristics row** (9.4): two
  `unit_type`s in `unit-characteristics.json`, `Engineer Bn/Coy-Eq` and
  `Construction (Road/RR)`, do not say whether they count as a battalion or
  a company. An explicit `equivalent` field (or a note per row) would let
  the engine stop guessing. Mission 2 slice 4 (stacking) counts them as
  companies meanwhile.
- **Track cost:** `rules/40-movement.md` (*Tracks*) says a track costs 1 CP
  per hex, but E-031 (and the same file at 8.37) says a track halves the
  hex's cost. Make the prose agree. Mission 2 slice 4 follows E-031 meanwhile.
