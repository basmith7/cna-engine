# Autopilot progress

Human-facing journal for the unattended runs (see `AUTOPILOT.md`). The
autopilot rewrites **Status** and **Next steps** at the end of every run and
the cron script appends to **Runs and quota**. The only section a human
writes is **Feedback**.

## Feedback


## Addressed

## Status

**Mission 2 (headless game state for Graziani's Offensive) Part 0 is up
for review** in PR #5, labelled `needs-brian`. Nothing for Mission 2 is
built until **Feedback** approves it.

cna answered all six requests (2026-10-08). PR #5 now vendors cna 18ed96e
and the spec uses the answers: cross-sheet seams, weapon-system ratings
for tanks and guns, R-110's Land-only victory supply (a truck route free
of enemy units and unoccupied enemy ZOC, so victory is now fully checked),
stacking equivalents per row, and the probe CP refund as `cp-costs.json`
has it. No open requests remain.

cna main has since moved on (its Mission 7, the Air Game, now complete:
air tables, schemas and R-111–R-116). Rechecked 2026-10-09 17:55Z: none of
it touches the map, scenarios, OA or Land Game data the spec uses, so PR #5
stays on 18ed96e; the bump waits for the first slice. cna's own queue is
finished, so both autopilots are now idle until this review lands.

CI on PR #5 was red from 2026-10-09 05:53Z: a journal commit bumped
`vendor/cna` by accident without regenerating `probes/`. Restored to
18ed96e (00ac7bd); the gates pass again.

**MISSION 1 COMPLETE** (2026-09-26): rules core with switches for R-001,
R-009, R-011, R-012, R-015, R-018 and eight probes in `probes/` (PRs #1–#4).

## Next steps

- **Review the Mission 2 spec: PR #5.** Approve (or ask for changes) under
  **Feedback**. Updated 2026-10-09 with cna's answers; the decisions table
  is the part worth reading.

For the autopilot: once Feedback approves, merge PR #5 and start slice 1
(map). Until then, nothing to build.

## Requests for cna

What this repo needs from cna, one bullet each: what, why, which mission it
blocks. cna's autopilot reads this every run and answers with a PR; delete
the bullet once it lands and `vendor/cna` is bumped.

(None open. The six from Mission 2's spec landed in cna 18ed96e; PR #5
bumps `vendor/cna` to it.)
